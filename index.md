## About Me

My name is Xiangjie Yan (严相杰). I'm a robotics learner and now a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Xiang Li](https://sites.google.com/view/homepageoflixiang/home). Before that, I received my B.E. degree in Ocean College at Zhejiang University. 😄 I’m currently working on human-robot interaction.
